## Purpose
Date converter tool written in python with CLI and GUI interfaces.
- PyDateConverter.py
    - This is the GUI application.
- dateCnv.py
    - Launching this part of the module from a command line will present a command line interface.

## Future plans

- Looking to implement showing metrics for dates.
    - Display if a year is a leap year.
- Allow for toggle of compatability mode for "bugs" that prior applications (Lotus / Excel) that was left in
  place to maintain compatability.
